# Introduction

Hi there :wave:

Firstly, i would like to thank you for taking an interest in making a contribution to the [K53 Guide PWA](https://www.k53guide.co.za) project. You are about to make an impact on the next generation of learner drivers in South Africa :muscle:

## What is the K53 Guide PWA?

The K53 Guide PWA is a little project aimed at democratizing, modernizing and making the K53 system accessible for the new learner drivers of South Africa. 

I came up with the idea last year July during the time i was studying for my K53 learners examination. The online material for the K53 was lacking in quality and appeal for the younger generation such as myself

I wanted to build something that can help a lot of people learn the K53 in a more modern way as well as provide the information freely

## Why should i use the K53 Guide PWA?

* It is completely free (No more paying for the book)
* It's a website that can be saved offline (using the latest web technologies)
* It uses **70%** less data than similiar apps on the **App Store / Play Store**
